    <h1>Q.2 How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</h1>
<h2>Ans.  Add audio and video elements to the page; make them display the default browser controls.
    Give both of them source elements so that browsers will find the audio format they
    support best and load it. These should include type attributes.</h2>

    <h1> Q.3 Semantic element in HTML5? </h1>
    <h2>Ans.  A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
        Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content.</h2>

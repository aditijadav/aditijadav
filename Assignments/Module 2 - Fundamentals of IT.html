    <h2>2. What is Hosting? </h2>
    <h4> It provides a secure place to store online content. The code, images, videos,
        <br>and text that comprise a website all have to be stored somewhere.
        <br>Without a stable digital repository, none of us could consistently
        <br>access content on the web.</br></h4>
